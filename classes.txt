/Java Classes/
in java whatever you do, do it in Classes. 

where to create class ?
class can be created in the same file.
eg:-

// Designing the operations done using the Calculator Class.
class calculator
{
	int x; 
	// not using just showing that we can have variables outside the methods that is inside the class only.

	public int add()
	{		system.out.println("adding..")
	int result = num1 + num2;
	return result;
	}
}

public class main()
{
	public static void main(String arg[])
	{
		int num1 = 4;
		int num2 = 4;
		calculator cacl = new calculator;
		cacl.add(num1,num2); // using the cacl object you are calling the add method. 
	}
}






note:- 
java is a statically typed language..
designing a class is not enough, you also need the Object

think of class as Idea and Objects as Products, Objects as Physical Object.
in the World of Programming we need a Virtual Object.
Analogy --> Object = Instance.
